## Setup

First clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/GamesTrap/ModernFileDialogs`.

ModernFileDialogs uses _Premake 5_ as a build generation tool. Follow [these](https://premake.github.io/download.html) instructions in order to install it.

Then, follow the steps relevant to your operating system.

### Windows

Premake can generate project files for several Visual Studio versions.
For example, run `premake vs2019` to generate the `.sln` and `.vcxproj` files for Visual Studio 2019.

### Linux

Premake can generate makefile project files.
For example, run `premake gmake2` to generate the `Makefile` files.
